RECURRING DEPOSIT CALCULATOR - RDC
-----------------------------------

Little python script coded in Python 3.4 
to calculate interest on recurring deposits and make a data chart.
Its still in its initial phase development and rather buggy.

COMPILING / INSTALLING / RUNNING 
-----------------------------------

No need to compile, no need to install!

You need to to install python interpreter (version 3.0 +) to run the .py file.
Or alternately, download the rdc.zip file which contains a precompiled rdc.exe file 
which can run without python installed on your system!

I would suggest you to install python and then run the .py file which provides more flexibility.
