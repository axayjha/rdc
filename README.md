RECURRING DEPOSIT CALCULATOR - RDC
-----------------------------------

Little python script coded in Python 3.4 
to calculate interest on recurring deposits and make a data chart.
It still in its initial phase of development and hence rather buggy.

COMPILING / INSTALLING / RUNNING 
-----------------------------------

No need to compile, no need to install!

Download the whole repository by clicking on 'Download ZIP' button on the bottom right corner of the page (https://github.com/axayjha/rdc)

You just need to install python interpreter (version 3.0 +) to directly run the .py file.
(Download Python from www.python.org/downloads)

Or alternately, extract the rdc.zip file which contains a precompiled rdc.exe file 
that can run without python installed on your system!

But, I would suggest you to install python and then run the rdc.py file which provides more flexibility.
Don't double click to run the rdc.py file. Instead right click on it, select Edit with IDLE. When it opens in IDLE,
press F5 to run it.
